# DirectX 8.1 SDK Dependency

> **Note:**  
> The DirectX 8.1 SDK provides the system libraries and headers required to build this legacy codebase.  
> While these libraries qualify as *system libraries* under [GPLv3](https://www.gnu.org/licenses/gpl-3.0.html), the SDK is proprietary and **cannot be redistributed or included in this repository** due to Microsoft’s licensing restrictions.

## Long-term Goal

This dependency should eventually be replaced with an open-source, cross-platform alternative such as **Vulkan** or **SDL**.

1. **Download** the DirectX 8.1 SDK from the link above.
2. **Extract** the SDK package.
