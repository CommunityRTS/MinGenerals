NVASM is the Nvidia's vertex and pixel shader macro assembler. It is 
needed for compiling the .nvp and .nvv shader files used by the game but
can not be included in the repo as it is proprietary software that is 
not compatible with GPLv3.

This dependency should be removed or replaced with a GPLv3
compatible alternative before release but in the meantime it can be 
acquired from the link below for use during development.
