The DirectX 8.1 SDK provides system libraries and headers needed to build
the legacy codebase. Although it qualifies as a system library (compatible
with GPLv3), the SDK is proprietary and cannot be included in this repository
due to Microsoft’s redistribution restrictions.

In the long term, this dependency should be replaced with an open-source,
cross-platform alternative such as Vulkan. For now, you can acquire the
DirectX 8.1 SDK for development purposes from the link below:
